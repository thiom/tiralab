# Weekly report, week 4

The program was already fully working a couple weeks ago so there are not that many updates. 
I've been adding some tests and comments. The test coverage tool has some weird behaviour 
so I've been playing around with that a little bit. I also tharted writing the implementation doc. 
The code is currently organized somewhat sketchy; the cli is in the lib.rs folder. I'll fix that 
as some point.
