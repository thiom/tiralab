# Weekly report, week 5

There are no major changes to the app itself. I changed the cli so that the program will exit after to consecutive 
empty strings (instead of just one). This makes sense since an empty string can be recognized by the language as well 
and thus requires support. Apart from that, I've been just working on the documentation.

I also submitted the peer review and spent a decent amount of time on that.
