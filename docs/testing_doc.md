## Testing

I generated the test code coverage reports using a tool called 
[grcov](https://github.com/mozilla/grcov). 
For now, the coverage is awfully poor, but it will be improved from here on.

The coverage report can be viewed 
[here](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/thiom/tiralab/blob/main/rs-regex/coverage/html/index.html).
