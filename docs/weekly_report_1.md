# Weekly report, week 1

This week I mostly just chose the subject for my project (regex interpreter). This alone took a decent amount of time 
because I had a few other ideas in the beginning, but after looking into them and the schedule of this course a bit more, 
those particular projects would have been too large for this course. The regular expression interpreter was one of the 
suggested projects and it seemed pretty interesting to me. I also wrote the project specification doc and started coding
the app a little bit. For now, I just have some of the cli interface working.
