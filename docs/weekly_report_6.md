# Weekly report, week 6

My plan was to finish the implementation document this week, but didn't end up having enough time for it. 
Here are some of the changes I made to the project:
- Moved the user guide to it's own file and added some examples and details there.
- Small changes to other docs as well
- Started writing a single page document for demoing the app. This will mostly cover the same information as the 
implementation doc, but in a slightly different format.
- Submitted the second peer review.
- Refactored the code a little bit. No changes to the core functionality.
- Added a few tests

Next week I should be able to complete the implementation document. I might also try out some other ways 
of generating and hosting the test coverage.
